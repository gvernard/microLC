# microLC: Microlensing Light Curves
Software package to model microlensing lightcurves from lensed Supernovae and Quasars. The code can work with multi-band data and can handle flux ratios as well. 


## Requirements

Requires the [gerlumph++](https://github.com/gvernard/gerlumphpp) library and the CUDA nvcc compiler.
