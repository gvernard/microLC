# microLC: Microlensing Light Curves
Software package to model microlensing lightcurves from lensed Supernovae and Quasars. The code can work with multi-band data and can handle flux ratios as well. 


## Requirements

Requires the CUDA nvcc compiler, the cfitsio and CCfits libraries.

## TODO

Test LC simulator in Single Precision mode.
